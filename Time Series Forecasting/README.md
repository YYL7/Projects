# Time Series Forecasting - LSTM

# Introduction

Time Series is a sequence of well-defined data points measured at consistent time intervals over a period of time.

Time Series Forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

LSTM (Long short-term memory), LSTMâ€™s), a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. We can use Keras pakage in python to do Time Series Prediction with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks.

The goal is to explore and predict the global land average temperature by time series forecasting with LSTM model.
